Building L20n.js
================

Install L20n in Node.js (using npm)
-----------------------------------

    npm install l20n

In your other project you can now require L20n:

    var L20n = require('l20n');
    var ctx = L20n.getContext();


Build L20n for the Clientside with HTML Bindings
------------------------------------------------

In order to use L20n on a webpage, all you need is an optimized to a single 
file, and possibly minified, version of the library with the HTML bindings.

    git clone https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js.git
    cd l20n.js
    npm install
    make build

This will produce the optimized files in `dist`.

    dist/html/l20n.js
    dist/html/l20n.min.js

It's recommended to include the l20n.js file as the last script in the `head` 
element.  The `L20n` object will be made globally available.

```html
<head>
  â€¦
  <script src="l20n.js"></script>
  <script>
    var ctx = L20n.getContext();
  </script>
</head>
```
