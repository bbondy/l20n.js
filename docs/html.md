The HTML Bindings
=================

You can take advantage of HTML bindings to localize your HTML documents 
with L20n.  


Download L20n with HTML Bindings
--------------------------------

We maintain a repository with L20n optimized for production use:

 - [one file](https://github.com/l20n/builds/blob/master/l20n.js) (~110KB)
 - [one file, minified](https://github.com/l20n/builds/blob/master/l20n.min.js) (~35KB)

It's recommended to include the l20n.js file as the last script in the `head` 
element.

```html
<head>
  â€¦
  <script src="l20n.js"></script>
</head>
```


Adding Resources
----------------

You can embed localization resources right in your HTML.  This may be useful 
when you first start a new project, or when determining server-side language 
negotiation.

```html
<script type="application/l20n">
  <brandName "Firefox">
  <about "About {{ brandName }}">
</script>
```

An alternative is to include localization resources in `script` elements.  Note 
that this still only works for a single language.  We plan to add support for 
a Language Pack Service in the future that can tap into this scenario on the 
client side.

```html
<script type="application/l20n" src="../locales/browser.l20n"></script>
```

Once you're ready to provide a multilingual version of your app, use  
a localization *manifest* to define available languages and their resource 
files.

```html
<link rel="localization" href="../locales/browser.json">
```

An example of the manifest file:
    
```json
{
  "locales": [
    "en-US",
    "pl"
  ],
  "resources": [
    "../locales/{{locale}}/browser.l20n",
    "/shared/{{locale}}/date.l20n"
  ]
}
```

Making HTML Elements Localizable
--------------------------------

Use the `data-l10n-id` attribute on a node to mark it as localizable.

```html
<p data-l10n-id="about"></p>
```

Notice that you don't have to put the text content in the HTML anymore (you 
still can if you want to).  All content lives in the localization resources.

When all DOM nodes are localized, `document` will fire a `DocumentLocalized` 
event.

Exposing Context Data
---------------------

You can expose important bits of data to the localization context in form of 
*context data*.

```html
<script type="application/l10n-data+json">
{
  "newNotifications": 3,
  "user": {
    "name": "Jane",
    "gender": "feminine"
  }
}
</script>
```

This data will be available context-wide to all localized strings.  For 
instance, a string could use the information about the user's gender to provide 
two variants of the translation, like in the example below. See [L20n by 
Example][] to learn more about L20n's syntax. 

[L20n by Example]: http://l20n.org/learn/

```php
<invited[$user.gender] {
  feminine: "{{ $user.name }} has invited you to her circles.",
  masculine: "{{ $user.name }} has invited you to his circles.",
 *unknown: "{{ $user.name }} has invited you to their circles."
}>
```

Based on the context data defined above, this will produce:

    Jane has invited you to her circles.
